Disclaimer: Use of this plugin is obviously against game rules, and up to the user's discretion. The purpose of this project is for experimentation with runelite plugin development. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

What I've done:

1. Added outline changes showing attack style of the boss. Green = ranged, blue = magic

TODO:

1. Instead of using the hitsplat event, use animation event so that when player gets hit by lightning, it doesn't count as the boss's attacks.

2. Done halfway: implement changing of player attack styles to suit boss's protection prayers. Counting is done and is somewhat accurate but display is not implemented, other than a simple "system.out.println".
